# From Bacteria to Beef
## *Improbable Beef Synthesis*

Roza has worked with start-up company, Improbable Beef, to study micro-organisms found in the human belly button that can synthesize proteins to tast like beef. From the data gathered from hundreds of Test Subjects, we have developed a webpage that shows several things:
* The top 10 bacteria cultures found in each test sample
* All of the various bacteria cultures found in every sample
* The number of times each test belly button is washed each week

With all of this research, Improbable Beef will soon develop the next best burgers!
